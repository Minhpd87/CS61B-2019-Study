2) If doubles are more versatile than ints, why don’t we always use them? Are there any disadvantages to doing this?

Because Integer are exact values so we don't lose information when doing calculations also they takes less memory
so if we don't need to use doulbe then we don't

3) How much does the memory cost differ between the storing of an address of a 32 entry int array and a 300 entry int array?

A 32 entry int[] array

= 32 * 4 bytes for each int = 128 bytes

A 300 entry int[] array

= 300 * 4 bytes for each int = 1200 bytes

so the difference is 1200 - 128 = 1072 bytes

If we are talking about the address of the array as in the address referenced to the array location
then they are the same, there is no difference. Always a box size of 64-bit for reference type.
